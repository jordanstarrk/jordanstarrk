# Hi, I’m Jordan 👋

I build and ship small products across consumer apps, developer tools, and applied AI systems. Some I open source.

Product Manager at Google.  


## Independent projects

**[mcp-preflight](https://github.com/jordanstarrk/mcp-preflight)** (open source)  
Preflight inspection for MCP servers before you trust them.

- Open-source CLI published on PyPI  
- Shows what an MCP server exposes (tools, resources, prompts) without executing anything  
- Useful when the client is an LLM, where risk depends on exposed capabilities, not just user intent  

It’s a bit like running `ls -la` on an MCP server: not a security guarantee, just basic visibility.

**[Meow Meow Woof](https://github.com/jordanstarrk/meow-meow-woof)** (open source)  
Chrome extension that plays a short cat or dog video on every new tab.

- ~5,300 users across 120+ countries (last year)  
- ~430 active users across 50+ countries in the last 30 days  
- 5.0★ rating on the Chrome Web Store  
- First solo project I built, shipped, and distributed  
- Learned real-world lessons about global latency, CDNs, and cost optimization

**[Lokalblatt](https://lokalblatt.ch/)** (private)  
Profitable German language-learning app.

- ~4,000 users  
- Subscription-based  
- Fully automated content pipeline  
- Closed source by design  

**LLM document parser** (open-sourcing soon)  
Human-in-the-loop system for extracting structured data from PDFs and images.

- Upload PDFs or screenshots  
- LLM-assisted extraction with flexible schemas  
- Users can ignore, group, and override fields via the UI  
- Designed for partial automation where full automation fails
